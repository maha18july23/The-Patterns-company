                             That's because it's easy and cost-effective! Social media is available on every platform — from mobile
                              devices to laptops and desktop computers — so it's a great way for small businesses to get their
                               message out to as many people as possible.
                              Small businesses don't have the budget or manpower required to create traditional
                                      advertising campaigns, 
                               but they can use social media as a way of building brand awareness and driving traffic back to their website.
